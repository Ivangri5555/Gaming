                    <h2>Amazing diversity of characters and gameplay</h2>
                    <p>For the first time in League of Legends history, every champion has been picked at least once in professional play during a single season.Last year, the professional scene went into the World Championship with just two characters left on the board – Annie and Vi. This time around, every champion in the game has been picked at least once, including some of the game’s newer additions like Qiyana and Yuumi, who have both seen extensive play on the pro level. Even recently reworked characters such as Pantheon and Mordekaiser have had an impact on the scene..</p>
